In this project, I created a program to spawn two children to try to guess a random number between 0-100 generated by the parent.
The first child would pick the average of the upper and lower bounds, and the second child would pick a random number between the bounds.
After each child makes a guess, the parent notifies each one if its guess is too high or too low, and each child will adjust their bounds accordingly.
This continues until one child guesses correctly.
